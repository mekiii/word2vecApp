# Word2Vec application with TED talk transcripts

The word2Vec app delivers similar words by training a machine learning model (word2vec by gensim) with TED talk transcripts. I am using the npm package [word2vec](https://www.npmjs.com/package/word2vec) to word with the model via nodejs. 

## Installation

First download or pull this master branch, then initialize the server application (install [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/) first, if you don't have it)

```bash
#Install all packages
npm install 
#Start the server
node serve.js
```

You can find the application on localhost:3000. 

## Usage

Just type in a word and after submission you will see the words that have been used the most in combination with this word.
